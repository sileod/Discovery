# Discovery : Mining Discourse Markers for Unsupervised Sentence Representation Learning


# Contents

The Discovery datasets consists of adjacent sentence pairs (s1,s2) with a discourse marker (y) that occured at the beginning of s2.
They were extracted from the [depcc](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/resources/data/depcc.html) web corpus. 

Markers prediction can be used in order to train a sentence encoders. Discourse markers can be considered as noisy labels for various semantic tasks, such as entailment (y=*therefore*), subjectivity analysis (y=*personally*) or sentiment analysis (y=*sadly*), similarity (y=*similarly*), typicality, (y=*curiously*) ... 

The specificity of this dataset is the diversity of the markers, since [previously used data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04334) used only ~10 imbalanced classes.
In this repository, you can find:
* a list of the 174 discourse markers we obtained
* a `Base` version of our dataset with 1.74 million pairs (10k exemples per marker)
* a `Big` version with 3.4 million pairs
* a `Hard` version with 1.74 million pairs where the connective couldn't be predicted with a fasttext linear model

# Instructions
Now available on Huggingface Datasets ðŸ¤— (GLUE-compatible format): 
```python
import datasets
datasets.load_dataset("discovery","discovery")
```
We also provide a script to collect new datasets in `demo.ipynb`

# Pretrained model
We also provide a huggingface ðŸ¤— pre-trained discourse connective prediction model built upon `roberta-base`.
https://huggingface.co/sileod/roberta-base-discourse-marker-prediction

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("sileod/roberta-base-discourse-marker-prediction")
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("sileod/roberta-base-discourse-marker-prediction")
```
This model can be used as a pretrained model for discourse/pragmatics related tasks.

# Discourse markers semantics:
We also provide a semantic analysis of the markers, which can be used for zero-shot classification (e.g. sentiment analysis)
